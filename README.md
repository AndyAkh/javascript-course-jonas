I created this repository in order to keep tracking my JavaScript course progress across several devices used (PC || work laptop || girlfriend's laptop).

I also added the entire course material provided by Jonas Schmedtmann for this absolutely awesome course!

It will be updated several times during my learning journey so I can continue my work even if I'll be at...work.
